## Chapter 3 Practice - Exercise 1
Here I want to tell you how to use Matlab to do linear regression, or say, linear fit.  

Suppose that you have a denpendent variable y with several independent variable x1,x2,x3..., and you know that y has a linear relationship with those independent variables, which is to say that 

$$y = \sum \theta_{i}x_{i} + \theta_0$$
