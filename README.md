# VG101 Repository
Welcome! Here is Zhang Yichi's repository of some tutorials and tips for VG101 class.   

In VG101 you will learn the basical knowledge about how to program using Matlab, C and C++. The three parts have their particular features and the teaching process will have different focuses. However, the course, as well as the professor Manuel Charlemagne, is very interesting. So I do hope that you can enjoy it.  

In this repository I will post some tutorials and tips on programming, which will mainly focus on the lectures, but there will also be some advaced knowledge, which you can skip if you want. And I will also post my brief comment on the weekly assignments and the exams.  

I really hope that this repository can help you, and I hope that you will have a good time in learning programming.

Best regards,  
Zhang Yichi
