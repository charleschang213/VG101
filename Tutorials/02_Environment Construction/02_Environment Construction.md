# Environment Construction
Here listed are the things that you need to install for this course.   

+ Matlab  
+ C/C++ environment (For Windows system, it is called MinGW)  
+ An IDE for C and C++(Code::Blocks, CLion) or a code editor(Visual Studio Code, Atom) (For this course, an IDE is recommended)  
+ OpenGL library  

This directory contains some tutorials on how to configure these tools, and you can find them based on what you want to configure and the system of your computer. You don't need to install all things at the beginning, but I suggest that you should at least install them in advance of the class progression. And this tutorial only tells you how to configure the softwares. As for the downloading and installation, you can manage yourself or with the help of Baidu.  

By the way, you can try to install a Linux system in your computer, and Ubuntu is what I recommend. You can either install a double system in your coputer or install a virtual machine using VMWare(our school has cooperation with this company so the software will be free). Although the Linux system will take you some time and space to install, but it will save you much effort when you install things concerned with C and C++(especially OpenGL). But it is not a mandatory thing, so it is OK if you don't want to install.
